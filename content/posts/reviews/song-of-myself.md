Here is something that will resonate with every art lover: you are an enjoyer of beauty, eternally looking for things capable of turning you on, but unfortunately, it is a rather bland art that you  most often find yourself consuming, which causes you a certain boredom. If you look for the grail, you only come across silver chalices, sometimes golden, but rarely mythical. But in spite of this, you continue to pillage old cathedrals and papal tombs, because you know it is only question of time before you stumble upon a unique piece of art, be it a book, a movie, or an album, that will deeply affect you, changes the way you see things, changes you. 
I myself relate with everything I just said, and it is exactly what happened to me recently when I discovered The Leopard. The story told by Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa, a Sicilian prince of the 19th century, is the kind that transcends time and space. In fact its impact on me was so great that it inspired me to start this personal blog you are currently visiting !

According to the very dear person who advised me to check out this book: "The Leopard is a fresco, large and magnificent". These words took on meaning the second I started reading the novel: in the very first pages the author tells us about decorated ceilings, fragrant gardens, and tailor-made frock coats. We quickly understand that we are dealing with one of those stories where dramatic twists and cliff hangers are blatantly absent and gracefully replaced by sumptuous storytelling and splendid attention to detail. In the likes of X and X, what makes The Leopard worthy of the chef d'Å“uvre title are the details in its writing. The author is extremely talented at describing events, decors, and thoughts in elegant figures of speech, without resorting to the use of complex vocabulary. Reading the Leopard feels natural and comfortable, its innuendos lay bare in the open. So, in order to appreciate the subtelty of his piece of art, what Tomasi Di Lampedusa requires of you is not a strong appetite for the complicated nor some advanced knowledge of semantics, but a sensitivity of the heart. Indeed, The Leopard, despite its historical and political setting, is essentially a love story, or rather a story of several loves: love of the nation, of the family, of beauty.

  as much in the Sicilian landscape of the 19th century, victim (or lucky one?) of Napoleonic nationalism, as in the charm of these dear Palermitan artistocrats.

While reading The Leopard, your heart may not skip a beat following an incredible twist and turn, but it will slowly become attached to its Palermitan characters. You will no longer be able to spend a day without feeling a pressing desire to hear from the "Salinas", thus you find yourself bringing forward your daily reading session by a few hours. And this experience, dear reader, is the holy grail that every literature lover is constantly seeking.
