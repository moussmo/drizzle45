The Louvre, in addition to looking simply incredible with its 17th century French renaissance architecture, holds the most impressive and richest art collection you will ever find in a museum. It is today one of the most visited places in the world, and each day some 25 000 visitors, mostly tourists, penetrate its intimacy looking for the so-called Louvre experience. The Louvre is 210 000 square meters of cultural heritage, spanning over hundreds of rooms interconnected in the most French way possible. So, in order to optimize their visits of the Mona Lisa owner, some people choose to pay for a tour and submit to their tour guide's pathing preferences, while others prefer to get happily lost between its walls, delegating the responsibility of finding the museum's Chefs d'œuvre to luck and panels. Being an amateur of museums who has experienced both kind of visits in the past, I have to admit that they both provide their own perks, fit different kind of people, and are in fine situational. For example, if your goal is to learn the most about the art pieces, having a tour guide is undoubtedly the preferred choice, but if time is not of the essence for you and you would rather enjoy independance as you stroll across centuries-old corridors, then you should definitely favour the free access. But there is actually a third option one should always consider: you could enjoy the freedom of solo visiting while experiencing the best the museum has to offer by following a predefined route, that is a series of steps arranged in a fashion that allows for maximum art discovery and maximum autonomy in a specific time duration. The Louvre itself suggests on its official website some routes for its visitors, they are in my opinion very good but aren't informative enough and can be too restrictive. Having visited the Louvre one too many times, I thought I could come up with routes of my own that do not completely suck, and this is what I am sharing with you in this article dear reader.

The routes I'm suggesting below are destined to all of you, but more specifically to whoever never visited the Louvre but is planning to do so in the near future, and would rather, due to xxx, do it in a reasonable time (because yes, you cannot and should spend the entirety of your Paris trip in a museum, one shall be doomed if they ever left the city without trying out its x).

Since we are talking about the largest art museum in the world, I couldn't think of a single and unique route that would do the place justice in a timely manner. I wouldn't want any of you to come out of the museum then shortly after come across a picture on the internet of a Louvre chef d'œuvre that was absent in my route. Instead I thought it would be best to suggest two routes, each exploring different art pieces from different cultures and civilizations in between 1h30 and 2h of museum hiking. If you had to pick only one of these two, I would strongly suggest going for the first route, especially if are very eager on discovering the famous pieces that give the Louvre its grandiose reputation. The first route focuses on the Denon wing of the museum, which includes famous paintings such as the Mona Lisa and La Liberté guidant le Peuple, as well as renown sculptures like The Dying Slave and Niké. The second route explores more niche and sadly underrated collections, corresponding to the ancient near east and egyptian civilizations.

The present article you are currently reading is dedicated to the first route. If you want to checkout the second one, check it out here.
